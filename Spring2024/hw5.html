# HW 5: Science Communication Extra Credit Homework

- **Due 4/16 11:59pm**
- Submission: Submit a zip/tar file to Canvas. Include your write-up (titled `Lastname_Firstname_hw5.pdf`) and a link to your content piece. 

------

## Goals

Part of responsible and ethical NLP involves communicating the potential impacts and pitfalls of AI or NLP systems to a wider audience. In this extra credit homework, we want you to practice communicating about NLP to a lay audience, using content formats that are commonly digested by lay people (e.g., social media, TikTok, etc.).


------

## Overview

In this assignment, you will create a short piece of social media content (e.g., TikTok/Instagram Reels/YouTube shorts video, henceforth: *content piece*) on a societal impact of NLP or AI systems that you learned about in class. This could be a bias in an NLP system that is not well-known, an exciting new positive application of NLP, or anything related to ethics of NLP that you feel people should know about.

Along with your video, you will submit a short write-up that describes your process (e.g., daily journal log, production diary, challenges), contributions of each team member, and answers to the rubric questions (see requirements below).

You do not have to post the video, simply upload it so that instructors can grade them.

------

## Requirements

- ***Topic & Content:*** Your content piece should be about the broad topics discussed in class and guest lectures (ethical philosophies of AI, bias in NLP systems, toxicity in language and in NLP systems, fake news and misinformation. privacy and security in NLP, NLP or AI for social good, etc.)
- ***Format & Length:*** Your video content piece must be 1-3 minutes long.
- Notes: 
  - *Teams:* You can pair up into teams of 2 people maximum. Make sure to indicate who did what in the write up contributions section.
  - Since this is extra credit, we ***encourage creativity***! Feel free to use various production techniques to make the content engaging (e.g., filters, effects) but be careful to not be too distracting. Definitely use ***visuals***!

## Grading rubric

- ***Clarity and depth*** (up to 5 points): how easily understandable is the content from a lay audience perspective? A clear piece should be well-structured and use as little jargon as possible, while still communicating a complex subject in a simple way. Pieces that are less clear can be overly complicated, jargony, or possibly overly simplified.
- ***Entertainment/production value*** (up to 5 points): how entertaining or well-produced is the content? A well produced piece uses techniques often used by viral YouTubers/TikTokers ([see various articles on how to make good TikToks](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+make+a+a+good++tiktok&ia=web)), has good hooks & captures the attention, and keeps people engaged until the end of the video. For this subject, using charts/graphs/visuals to explain concepts will likely help.
- ***Topic timeliness and relevance*** (up to 5 points): how relevant to today's conversation is the topic you chose to cover? A relevant piece should draw on the subjects that are relevant or talked about today and provide a new expert perspective on it. The subject itself could be older, but you have to explain why it's relevant to current times.
- ***Accuracy*** (up to 5 points): how accurate or correct is the content? Simply put, an accurate content piece explains the concepts in lay terms without (unintentionally) distorting the facts, editorializing, sensationalizing, misinterpreting, etc.

Note, grades for this extra credit assignment will be curved just on this extra assignment, and then added to the curved final grades (i.e., you do not have to do this extra credit assignment to get a top grade in this class).

------

## Submission information
**Submitting your video**: please upload your video and include the link at the top of your write-up, as well as in a comment in Canvas.
- You do not have to make your content piece publicly available (unless you want to). You can upload the video to YouTube as unlisted (see [here on how to do that](https://wiki.umbc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=31198917)).

**Write-up:** The assignment description should be 1-2 pages in ACL format, `FirstName_LastName_hw5.pdf`. Please do not write more than 3 pages. Your proposed assignment write-up should include:

- Description of your process for creating the content piece (how did you choose the subject and why, how did you edit the content, etc)
- Short paragraph answers to the grading rubric: for each of the rubric criteria, write 2-3 sentences on how you ensured that your content satisfied that criterion.
- Include a note telling us whether it's okay for us to show your content in class (but not publicly).
- (For teams only) contribution statement describing who did what for the content creation.

For teams, both team members should upload the write-up, making sure their team member is named explicitly.
